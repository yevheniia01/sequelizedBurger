## Week of 15 Burger 2: The Sequel; using Sequelize 

*sequelizeBurger* is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of the burgers they like to eat.  When user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page with a button next to it that says "Devour it!".  When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page and the app enters a timestamp in the burgers_db.
